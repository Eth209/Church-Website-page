        <p><h3>
            “In essentials, unity. In non-essentials, liberty. In all things, love.”

            As a nondenominational church, we come from a variety of diverse backgrounds. While foundational essentials exist and are a part of our Statement of Faith, we also acknowledge that within the framework of a Biblical worldview and Christian living, there are non-essentials (those elements not directly related to sin, salvation, and the nature of God) upon which we may disagree. We will always endeavor to approach every issue and instance of disagreement with love. We understand that in some of these instances, believers may lovingly agree to disagree, while in others our point of view may grow and change resulting in even deeper unity. 
            We were founded and function on the core principles of the Word of God and hold to the historic Christian view of life as presented in the Bible.
            We believe in one God who exists in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe that the Bible is His inspired, infallible, authoritative, and inerrant Word. We believe in Jesus Christ; His deity, virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, atoning death, resurrection, ascension, and future return. We believe that mankind is sinful and in need of a Savior - who is Jesus Christ - and regeneration by the Holy Spirit. We believe in the continuing ministry of the Holy Spirit, the resurrection of the saved and the lost, the spiritual unity of believers in Christ, and that the creation of man was and is a direct act of God who defines us in every facet of our being.
